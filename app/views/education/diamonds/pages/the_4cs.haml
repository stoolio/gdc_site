            %strong Carat weight is less a “grade” than it is a measurement.
            %blockquote
              It is important to note that Carat is a measure of weight, not size. Usually, diamonds get larger as they get heavier, but cut affects the appearance of the size as well.

            %strong The true size of a diamond can be found from it's millimeter measurements
            %p
              Every certificate has a diamond's measurements in addition to it's weight. They look like:
              .text-center
                %code 1.23 - 1.25 x 3.45 mm
                %br
                or
                %br
                %code 2.46 x 1.35 x 1.98 mm
            %p
              The first number is the diameter or spread of the stone. On a round diamond, this is the length across the top. The dash between the first two numbers is usually Other diamonds can have both a length and width, which will be represented by the first 2 numbers. The last number is the height of the stone.
            %p
              This allows you to quickly and easily compare diamond's size. It can be interesting to see how differences in weight affect size as well.
            .panel.notice.radius
              Round diamonds technically have a length and width as well, but they are usually the same, or very close. If they weren't, it would be an Oval diamond.

          %li
            %strong Carat weight has a <em>major</em> effect on price
            %blockquote
              A diamond that is twice the weight could cost 4x more than a smaller diamond.
            %p
              The main takeaway: you can’t spend twice as much to get a diamond that weighs twice as much. In addition, getting a smaller diamond can save you a bundle.

          %li
            %strong Be aware of <em>"Under Size"</em> diamonds
            %blockquote
              Diamonds are priced based on a special price list. It consists of tables of prices, with each table representing a particular range of carat weights.
            %p
              For instance, a 0.95ct diamond will be priced based on the 0.90ct-0.99ct table, rather than the 1.00ct-1.25ct table. So, despite the small difference in size, that 0.95ct diamond can cost much less than a similar 1.00ct diamond.
            %p
              If you ask to look at 1.00ct diamonds, that is most likely what you will see. If you let your jeweler know you would be okay getting something a few points smaller (1 carat = 100 points), you might get lucky.
            .panel.notice.radius
              A diamond cutter is usually trying to maximize weight, which is why you'll find less under size diamonds. It makes more sense financially to cut a diamond above or at a size cut-off, rather than under.
            %p
              For your reference, here are the tables ranges, with example "under size" diamonds:

          %li
            %strong Although it is a cold calculating number, carat weight can be very visual
            %blockquote
              You might be surprised at how small the difference in <em>size</em> is compared to a difference in <em>weight</em> (and cost!).
            %p
              Many consumers may get stuck on getting at least a certain size, but you should have a look to make sure the difference in size is worth the difference in cost. This is the visual part of of carat weight. Don't think you can just browse certificates or stats, different diamonds have different looks based on their collection of grades. You might find a smaller, well cut diamond is more impressive than a larger, duller one.

        %p
          This won't be the last time you hear this, but nothing beats seeing a diamond in person. See some live diamonds before you make any decisions and you will have a much better idea of what you want.

          It can be very difficult to tell the difference between diamond color grades. This makes color a flexible trait, and many are perfectly happy with a lower color diamond, especially when you can use the money you save for some extra size or clarity.

            %strong Diamond color ranges from D-Z

          Even when diamonds are grades apart, it can be difficult to notice color differences unless you have both diamonds side by side. So, don't be afraid of lower color diamonds. However, we generally don't recommend going lower than J color. Past that, the yellow color of a diamond can become too noticeable.

        %p
          The important thing is to set your center stone with color matched side stones. Set properly, the color of your diamond won't be an issue.

        .panel.warning.radius
          This is one reason why premade rings are problematic. Since they are already set with diamonds, you won't have the luxury of ensuring they match your center stone.

          Diamond clarity is a grade that is assigned based on a manual review of the diamond by mapping the type, size, and location of inclusions. All diamonds have inclusions, with the exception of flawless diamonds (which are very rare and expensive). Regardless of the actual grade, finding a diamond that is <em>eye clean</em> is the most desirable.
        %p
          An inclusion is something in the diamond that doesn’t quite belong. Diamond Inclusions are also called flaws, but don’t think that this means it is defective. Flaws give character to diamonds and make them unique.

        .panel.success.radius
          %p
            The type, <a>amount</a>, and location of inclusions in a diamond act like a fingerprint. No two diamonds are alike.

        %p
          Due to the nature of diamond clarity, it is graded by a human. Since a human grades the diamond clarity there is always room for opinion. Each lab has set rules based on the size, position, and type of inclusion, but it is up to the grader to make a final decision. This means its important to view a diamond in person and get the help of an expert to ensure that the diamond you are getting is up to your standards.
        %p
          The diamond clarity grades meanings are explained below, going from flawless to included, along with some important points to consider when diamond shopping:

        %h4
          FL&mdash;Flawless
        %ul
          %li
            No visible inclusions under 10x magnification
          %li
            Very rare and expensive
        .panel.notice.radius
          %p
            In almost all cases you can do better with a lower diamond clarity and larger diamond carat weight, better diamond color, or most importantly, a nicer cut diamond.

        %h4
          IF&mdash;Internally Flawless
        %ul
          %li
            No visible inclusions under 10x magnification
          %li
            Flaws only on the surface of the diamond, called blemishes
          %li
            Both FL and IF are sometimes referred to as &#8220;Museum Quality&#8221;
        .panel.notice.radius
          %p
            Most consumers still choose a lower clarity so that other traits can be maximized for their budget due to the rarity and cost of these diamonds.


        %h4
          VVS&mdash;Very Very Slightly Included
        %ul
        %li
          Few flaws at 10x magnification
        %li
          It takes a skilled grader to notice inclusions in a VVS diamond
        %li
          For grades with numerical levels, a higher number is better
        .panel.notice.radius
          %p
            VVS is still considered unnecessary for most consumers. In addition to the price, it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between a VVS quality diamond and a nice VS (or even SI) quality diamond with the naked eye.

        %h4
          VS&mdash;Very Slightly Included
        %ul
        %li
          Inclusions that are slightly easier to see under 10x magnification
        %li
          VS diamonds are both great looking and reasonably priced
        %li
          An average consumer looking for a &#8220;high quality&#8221; diamond will generally get a VS1
        .panel.warning.radius
          %p
            Very slightly can mean many things. Not every single VS diamond will be eye clean, although you can almost never go wrong with a VS1. View your diamonds in person and use a Jeweler who you trust and will help you to select a diamond with a clarity that works for you.


        %h4
          SI&mdash;Slightly Included
        %ul
          %li
            Noticeable inclusions at 10x magnification
          %li
            Beautiful, eye-clean diamonds can still be found in this category
          %li
            They are a popular choice if your looking for a deal
          %li
            Finding an "eye clean" SI2 is tricky, but possible
        .panel.radius
          %p
            Watch out, especially in SI graded diamonds, you have to be more careful of larger more prominent inclusions in highly visible parts of the diamond. A large whitish inclusion may be acceptable to you, where a smaller darker one may not. As always, get a look at the diamond to make the best decision.


        %h4
          I&mdash;Included
        %ul
          %li
            Large, numerous, or obvious inclusions at 10x magnification
          %li
            Unsightly inclusions visible to the naked eye are almost guaranteed
          %li
            Prices are lower, but the average consumer will go for a higher clarity
          %li
            Certain inclusions can affect the strength and durability of the stone
          %li
            As a general rule, we don&#8217;t work with I grade diamonds
        .panel.radius
          %p
            You might consider moving up a clarity grade or getting a slightly off-color or smaller stone to work within your budget. Most consumers choose a higher clarity, and we don't bother searching for clean stones in this grade range or below.

        %p
          You might notice that VS and SI clarity diamonds were emphasized. The majority of stones fall into these diamond clarity grades due to their combination of reasonable price and great look. It is also very possible to find diamonds graded VS1, VS2, SI1, or SI2 with no major inclusions.
        .panel.warning.radius
          EGL certificates include an SI3 clarity grade. It is somewhere in between a GIA SI2 and I1. Since GIA is known for stricter grading standards, we don’t generally carry or sell EGL certified diamonds. However, if we did, we would avoid most SI3 clarity diamonds.
        %p
          For our customers, we always allow you to view diamonds though a jeweler’s loupe at 10x (and 20x) magnification. If your Jeweler isn’t showing you diamonds up close, there may be something there they don’t want you to see.
        %p
          Being aware of whats going on inside the diamond is good info, and being able to see it the same way a grader does (at 10x magnifications) is smart. However, most people won't be seeing your diamond so close. Find out what your comfortable with, and find the best diamond you can that fits your personal requirements.

          Cut

          Of all of the four C’s, cut may be one of the most important in terms of overall beauty. It can also be one of the most confusing.

          Diamond Cut is based on the structure and measurements of the diamond. Don’t get Diamond Cut confused with Diamond Shape. They are often used interchangeably, but they are very different.

          In reality, Cut is an overall assessment describing many sub-traits: Depth, Table, Polish, and Symmetry to name a few. However, only Round diamonds receive an actual cut grade from GIA. Other shapes just have accepted ranges or guidelines for each characteristic.

            There is not one perfect combination of depth, table, or symmetry. An ideal cut can be several combinations of factors. GIA conducted a study when it developed its Round Diamond Cut grading system and it found that there were several “hot spots” of values that would create an exceptionally pleasing Round Brilliant diamond. The most important fact you can take away from this is that viewing a diamond is always the best way for you to grade its value to you.

          A poorly cut diamond, no matter how outstanding its clarity or color, won’t reflect light properly.

          As it turns out, the interaction of a diamond with light is the foundation for their prized brilliance, scintillation, and fire. While these three sound like fancy marketing terms, they each refer to a specific aspect of a diamond&#8217;s appearance:

                Scintillation &ndash; The "sparkle" of the diamond. The intense flashes of light that are produced.

                Fire &ndash; Created by the diamond's ability to split light. Flashes of color much like rainbow

          Using a Round Brilliant as an example, we can see below how depth, for instance, can make or break the reflection of light that will make your piece of Jewelry really stand out.

          Ideal cut diamonds will command a premium over their less exact counterparts, but make sure you seriously consider the most important factor, the sparkle in your eye. Our recommendation is to make sure that your Jeweler takes diamond cut into account and works with you to balance other traits so you can get an eye-popping diamond at the right price.

          There are many other systems and methods of categorizing diamonds based on their cut or light performance, but they fail to take into account human desire. We like to think a diamond purchase should be based on your particular feelings about any particular stone, rather than a cold mathematical system of grading. We don’t use these qualifications to pick stones, and instead, we actually look at each diamond before we show it to you. In this way, we ensure that you only spend your time looking at diamonds that look great, regardless of grades or measurements.

          As a guide, diamond cut can help to separate out the haves from the have nots. What it shouldn&#8217;t be is the only measurement by which you select your diamond. It may take some time, but with the help of a conscientious jeweler, you can find a diamond in the rough.
