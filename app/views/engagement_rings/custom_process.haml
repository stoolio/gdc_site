%h1 Custom Ring Design

%p
  Many customers are happy with some of the designs featured on our #{page_link('engagement-rings', 'engagement rings page')}. However, sometimes you want something a bit more unique and special.

%p
  For those of you who want full control over your ring design, we offer full custom design services. This service is most popular for engagement rings, but we can also design & manufacture bracelets, pendants, and other jewelry.

%p
  If you choose to go the custom route, it can be helpful to have an idea of how the process works.

%p
  There are 4 major steps:

%ul
  %li
    %h2 Brainstorm the Design
    %p
      At this stage, we will look through images of rings and try to find some inspiration for your design. If you see any ideas or designs you like, you can email or bring them in to the office to your appointment. The goal here is determine the types of designs you enjoy the most.
    %p
      Once we've worked out what your looking for, we will develop a custom design to suit your tastes and budget.
  %li
    %h2 Create the CAD
    %p
      CAD stands for <b>C</b>omputer <b>A</b>ided <b>D</b>esign. Using special computer software, we will create a 3D model of your ring. This allows us to provide images of the design, including realistic renderings, so you can have a look at what we've spent our time together creating.

    %p
      After you've seen what the final product might look like, you might decide to make a few changes. At this stage, it is very easy to tweak everything until it looks just right.

    %p
      Once we've finalized the design, we will be able to better estimate metal and diamond weights to provide you with a more accurate quote. Once you've approved everything, we move on to the next step.
  %li
    %h2 Print Wax
    %p
      A very expensive and specialized 3D printer is now used to create a wax mold of your design. If you'd like, you can have a look at the wax to see your ring in life size. It won't have diamonds or be the right color, but compared to the large CAD images, it gives you a better idea of the size and scale of your ring.
    %p
      We are on the home stretch. Once you've approved the wax, we'll get it into casting so it can be turned into the ring of your dreams.
  %li
    %h2 Casting & Finishing
    %p
      If your ring features diamonds, we will start selecting out only the very best VS quality melee (jewelers term for the small diamonds featured in jewelry), matched to the color of your center stone.
    %p
      During the casting process, the wax is lost. It is used to create a mold, and then melted out. Your choice of metal will be used, and out will pop the rough casting of your ring.
    %p
      At this stage, it will need to be buffed and polished to the shiny perfection that jewelry is known for. Any diamonds, including your center, will then be set.

%h2 Last Steps
%p
  Finally, we will get a complimentary independent appraisal for your finished ring, and then everything will be ready to pick up. If the size isn't quite right, just bring it in for a complimentary resizing.
%p
  After that, it's up to you!
%p
  Will this be an engagement ring, part of a surprise for your bride to be? Or, will it be an anniversary ring or other gift?
