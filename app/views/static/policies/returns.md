# We want you to be 100% happy

Above and beyond any other policy we may have, we put your happiness first.

We also like to keep things simple, so without further ado:

## Return Policy

### Policy for Ready Made (Non-Custom) items

* We offer a 30 day return policy on all non-custom items
* Items must be returned in the condition in which they were received with all accompanying paperwork
* You must contact us to start the return process
* Once you expressed your intent to return an item, directions will be provided for shipping the item back
* We will pay return shipping

### Policy for Custom Made pieces

Before you read the items below, we would like you to know one thing:

We have been making custom jewelry for over 25 years. In all our years of business, we haven't had one single return. In the very few cases where a client wasn't absolutely thrilled with their purchase, we discussed the reasons why they were unhappy with their purchase, and we made it right.

* Minor modifications will most likely incur no additional cost
* Re-sizing is free for the first year
* Major work that will require re-manufacture of your jewelry may require an additional fee
* We will do whatever we can, within reason, to make sure you are happy with your purchase
* If we cannot come to a mutually agreeable solution, please read the details below

We may accept returns of custom-made jewelry provided you pay any design and labor fees, at our discretion. Our jewelers and designers have put hours of love into making your unique piece of jewelry. If it would make you happy, they will put in a couple more.
