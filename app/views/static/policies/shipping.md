# How much does Shipping cost?

All shipping is per order. It doesn't matter how many items you purchase, your shipping charge (if any) is a flat rate.

We offer free FedEx Next Day shipping on all orders above $2000.

Standard FedEx shipping that delivers in 1-5 business days is $15.

FedEx Next Day shipping on orders under $2000 is available for $50.

## When will my items ship?

To guarantee same-day shipping, please make your order by *3:00pm Central Standard Time*.

Any orders made after that time will be shipped the next day.

However, we will do our best to ship your Ready Made orders the day they are received.

## _Note:_

If there is any issue with your order, or there might be a problem getting your order out in time, we will contact you to discuss your options.

Custom order times will vary, but expect 3-4 weeks for design and manufacture.
